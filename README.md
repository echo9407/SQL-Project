# Ted Talk Data Analysis Project
We are a small consulting team working with a well-known research university to better understand how they can improve their marketing effectiveness by using digital channels and posting educational videos on the web. 
The client ultimately wants to help its professors and researchers land speaking gigs at prestigious conferences and gain status in higher academic circles. 
The client wants to use the TED Talk dataset to better understand how different qualities of videos (e.g. length, title, descriptions, topics) affect their views and ratings numbers. 
The client can apply these insights to improve the qualities of their own videos in hopes of gaining more views and getting better ratings.
